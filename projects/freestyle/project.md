# Freestyle Project

TBA - Identify and analyze an existing business problem, then propose an Information System solution. Describe the system's objectives and information requirements, and diagram its scope. Then write Python software to accomplish or otherwise demonstrate partial system functionality. Students will propose their own projects and may propose to work in small teams. After implementing some functionality, students will reflect on any changes between original requirements and those actually delivered. Preliminary example project ideas include:

  + Social Media API Client
  + Weather API Client
  + Stock Market API Client
  + Stock-trading Algorithm
  + Database-connected Application
  + Web Application
  + PDF-parsing Application
  + Natural Language Processing Application
  + Statistical Modeling Application
