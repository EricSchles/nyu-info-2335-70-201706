# Freestyle Project

Create a software program or application based on your own interests and experiences.

Preliminary example project ideas include:

  + Social Media API Client
  + Weather API Client
  + Stock Market API Client
  + Stock-trading Algorithm
  + Database-connected Application
  + Web Application
  + PDF-parsing Application
  + Natural Language Processing Application
  + Statistical Modeling Application

Optionally work in a team of at most three students. Feel free to discuss ideas in the `#freestyle` Slack channel.

## Learning Objectives

  1. Propose and define requirements and objectives for an information system solution to a personal or professional problem or opportunity.
  1. Research and plan the information system's technology components, including third-party software packages and hardware providers, as necessary.
  1. Write software in Python to implement system objectives.

## Instructions

TBA - proposal phase, implementation phase

### Proposal Phase

TBA - choose one of these or propose your own with similar scope and objectives

  + Web-based CRUD Application
  + PDF Scraper
  + Web Scraper
  + Natural Language Processor
  + Twitter Bot (API Client)

#### Group Proposals

If you would like to work on this project in groups of two or three total students, the Proposal Form will contain a section for you to optionally specify your group preferences. Note: to avoid confusion, each group member must specify the email addresses of each other member for the proposal to be valid.

### Implementation Phase

#### Implementation Requirements

TBA - repo must include:

  + README.md with instructions on how to run the program, including instructions on how to install any dependant packages. README instuctions can assume the reader has already installed python and is using the pip package manager.
  + sub-directory called `planning` or `requirements` to contain information about system requirements and objectives. including a visual depiction of system information inputs and outputs and a written description of system scope.
  + python files comprising the program, application, or script
  + optional tests, if included must accompany README instructions on how to run them.

## Submission Instructions

To earn credit for the proposal component of this project, submit the [Proposal Form](________) by 2017-07-23.

To earn credit for the implementation component of this project, edit the [submissions.csv file](submissions.csv) by adding a new row to include your GitHub username and your project's GitHub repository URL.  Then commit your changes and submit a Pull Request for your changes to be included in the course repository. See the [Contributor Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions. At this time, you are encouraged to use the Git CLI to submit your work.

## Evaluation

The project grade comprises a proposal component worth 25% and an implementation component worth 75%. There is also an opportunity for extra credit.

  + A proposal submitted on-time is worth 25%. Else late proposals may receive partial credit.
  + A relevant and comprehensive implementation of stated system objectives is worth 75%. See the [Implementation Requirements](#implementation-requirements) section for details.
  + Presence of relevant and meaningful software test(s) will earn an additional 5-10% bonus points to be applied towards the weight of this project.
