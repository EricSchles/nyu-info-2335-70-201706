# Freestyle Project Example - CRUD Application w/ Web Interface and Database (Django and PostgreSQL Implementation)

Use Python to create a CRUD application with a web browser-based interface and SQL datastore.

For optional further exploration, deploy your application to a Heroku server and visit it online. Optionally configure the Heroku server to execute one of the application's scripts at scheduled intervals.

For optional further exploration, integrate any one of the other project examples to provide a web browser-based interface.
